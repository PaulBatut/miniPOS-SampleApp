# JPS uCube Touch miniPOS 

###### Release 1.0.0.9



This repository provides a step by step documentation for JPS's miniPOS SDK, that enables you to integrate our proprietary card terminal(s) to accept credit and debit card payments (incl. VISA, MasterCard, American Express and more).

The miniPOS is a standolone POS solution which has the connectivity capability via WI-FI and 4G/2G. The Payment application runs on the terminal it self. The device integrates 3 processors : Modem processor, Secure processor (SVPP) and WI-FI processor. The modem processor is the applicatif processor and the mobile connectivity provider. The Secure processor manages the communication with the card and the secure operations. The WI-FI processor provides the WI-FI connectivity. 

We give our clients the possibility to develop their payment applicationon the modem, however we provide binaries of the two firmwares WI-FI and secure processor (SVPP). Since the relation between Modem and the two others processor is a Master-Slave relation. So, The MODEM drives this two processors. 
The main function of the SDK is to send RPC commands to the SVPP and the WI-FI in order to drive them. The SDK provides also a payment, update and log APIs.  

The SDK contains several modules:  RPC, Payment, MDM, Network.  

* The RPC module use an SPI interface to send/receive, RPC command/response from secure processor. It provides an implementation of all RPC Commands you will see next how to use that in your application.
* The Network module implement the data exchnage usin mobile data and the WI-FI. The application can use it to call webservices. An example is provided next.
* The MDM module is an implementation of all JPS's TMS services. The TMS server is mainly used to manage the version of firmware and ICC / NFC configurations of card terminal. So the SDK allows you to transparently update of the terminal using our TMS. This module is useless if you decide to use another TMS not the JPS one.
* The payment module implements the EMV transaction processing for contact and contactless. The SDK takes in input a UCubePaymentRequest structure. Is is used to configure the current payment and durring the transaction a callback is returned for every step. At the end of transaction a PaymentContext  structure is returned which contains all necessary data to save the transaction.  
An example of Payment call is provided next.

All this functions are resumed in one Class which is UCubeAPI.

The SDK do not save any transaction or update data.

## I. General overview 

### 1. Introduction

JPS mPOS card terminals are : 
* uCube Touch mPOS
* uCube Touch miniPOS

The uCube Touch exist in two versions, first one needs the smartphone to communication with the server, the secod one is a standalone version. Which has the connectevity and the payment application runs directly on the device.

This github is specific to the miniPOS version. For more information about mPOS version please refers to these github repo
* [Android SDK](https://github.com/YouTransactor-SAS/mPOS-SDK-Android/)
* [IOS SDK](https://github.com/YouTransactor-SAS/mPOS-SDK-IOS/)

</p>

### 1. The Management System

The management system can be administered by JPS and offers the following services:

- Management of the uCube fleet

- Deployment of software updates

- Deployment of payment parameters

- Other services

The MDM module of SDK implements all our management system services and the UCubeAPI provides methods to call this implementation.

### 2. Terminal management

#### 2.1 Initial configuration
To be functional, in the scope of PCI PTS requirement, and SRED key shall be loaded securely in the device. This key is loaded locally by JPS tools. The initial SALT is injected in the same way.

#### 2.2 Switching On/Off
The uCube lights up by pressing the "ON / OFF" button for three seconds. Once the device is on, the user can initiate the payment process.  
The uCube switches off either by pressing the "ON / OFF" button or after X* minutes of inactivity (* X = OFF timeout).

#### 2.3 Update
During the life of the terminal, the firmware can be updated (to get bug fix, evolutions..), the contact and contactless configuration also can be updated. The Terminal's documentation describe how these updates can be done and which RPC to use to do that.

## II. Technical Overview

### 1. General Architecture

#### 1.1 Hardware Architecture                                       
uCube Touch miniPOS integrates a Quectel modem (BG95-M3) and a St-microelectronics secure processor (STM32L4).  
The modem is running the SDK software including the application demo “appmodem” while the secure processor is running the SVPP software that is controlling display, keyboard and has interface with EMV contact and contactless modules.  
  
![architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59020462/159263753-7a32a338-6951-4152-bc61-9cb957dd0892.png)
 
#### 1.2 Application Architecture
This diagrams describes the general software architecture. Only the uCubeAPI methods and the RPC commands are public and you can call them.  

![sdk_architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59020462/159264003-747c1615-9525-42f9-8b8f-acaef9d29e74.png) 

The demo application we provide display a menu as a first screen, user will be able to select one of the options example 'Payment', so the application will call the UCube_api_pay with a uCubePaymentRequest intance as input.   
This starts a transaction and enable the contact and the contactless readers. Depends on the activated reader one of the transaction flows will be called.  
This sequence diagram below shows the interaction between different soft modules before the menu is showen and when user press Payment option.
  
![sequence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59020462/159264182-f60ffd83-e5df-40d5-8a20-067e90bc9d75.png)

### 2. Transaction Flow : Contact

![contact_flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59020462/159264254-7ae827f1-df93-4463-ac2b-0e6deee01c48.jpeg)

### 3. Transaction Flow : Contactless

![contactless](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59020462/159264392-375f7822-2956-4810-aace-772eb9df45e5.jpeg)

### 4. UCubeAPI

The APIs provided by UCubeAPI are:

```c
// start a payment
 /*
  * use this api when you need to start a transaction
  * the SDK implement the contact and the contactless transaction flow
  * @param UCubePaymentRequest_t : object with all needed data in input of the transaction
  * and all callbacks that the SDK will call at a specific moment of the transaction.
  * e.g. onProgress() callback, AuthorisationTask callback,...etc.
  * The paymentContext object is created at the begin of transaction, his input variable are set 
  * from the begin of the transaction, they can be updated during that and all output variable 
  * are set during and at the end of the transaction. 
  * */ 
error_t  UCube_api_pay(UCubePaymentRequest_t* uCubePaymentRequest);

// connect to network using cellular connectivity
error_t  UCube_api_connect(network_handler_t * network_handler);

// send a HTTP request
error_t  UCube_api_send_http_request(socket_handler_t * socket_handler);

// send  RPC 
uint8_t UCube_api_send_Data(svpp_com_transaction_param_u  rpc_param,
         uint32_t rpc_id);
```

#### 4.1 Payment  

The SDK implements the payment state machine, both contact and contactless. You configure your transaction using the uCubePaymentRequest_t object by specifing a value for each attribut, for instance, the transaction amount, currency, type, ...etc.  

#### pay API

Create a Payment Request variable :

```c
  UCubePaymentRequest_t UCubePaymentRequest_ct;
```

Call the UCube_api_pay and pass a pointer to the uCubePaymentRequest:

```c
  UCube_api_pay(&UCubePaymentRequest_ct);
```  

The input parameter of Pay API is the uCubePaymentRequest. This class contains all input variables of a payment. At the begin of the transaction, the SDK create a new instance of PaymentContext and save into it all the input values. Here is an example of preparing a uCubePaymentRequest object, all variables are explained in the PaymentContext section :

```c
error_t preparePaymentRequest(UCubePaymentRequest_t * UCubePaymentRequest) {

    error_t err = ERRORNO;
    
    Language preferredLanguageList[1];
    
    Currency CURRENCY_EUR;
    
    CardReaderType readerList[2] = {ICC,NFC};

    Date date;
    
    uint16_t authorizationPlainTags[]={TAG_4F_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER,TAG_50_APPLICATION_LABEL };
    
    uint16_t authorizationSecuredTags[]={

            TAG_SECURE_5F20_CARDHOLDER_NAME,
            TAG_SECURE_5F24_APPLICATION_EXPIRATION_DATE,
            TAG_SECURE_5F30_PAYMENT_CODE,
            TAG_SECURE_9F0B_CARDHOLDER_NAME_EXTENDED,
            TAG_SECURE_9F6B_TRACK_2_DATA
    };
  
    uint16_t finalizationPlainTags[]={

              TAG_9F10_ISSUER_APPLICATION_DATA,
              TAG_9F1A_TERMINAL_COUNTRY_CODE    
    };
    
    uint16_t finalizationSecuredTags[]={
            TAG_SECURE_5F24_APPLICATION_EXPIRATION_DATE,
            TAG_SECURE_5F30_PAYMENT_CODE        
    };

    UCubePaymentRequest->authorizationPlainTags_len =  sizeof(authorizationPlainTags)/sizeof(uint16_t);
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->authorizationSecuredTags_len = sizeof(authorizationSecuredTags)/sizeof(uint16_t);
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->finalizationPlainTags_len =  sizeof(finalizationPlainTags)/sizeof(uint16_t);
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->finalizationSecuredTags_len = sizeof(finalizationSecuredTags)/sizeof(uint16_t);

    CURRENCY_EUR.currency_code[0] = (uint8_t)((SVPP_COM_CUREENCCY_EURO & 0xFF00) >> 8);
    
    CURRENCY_EUR.currency_code[1] = (uint8_t)(SVPP_COM_CUREENCCY_EURO & 0x00FF);
    
    CURRENCY_EUR.currency_exp = 2;

    preferredLanguageList[0].language[0] = 'e';
    
    preferredLanguageList[0].language[1] = 'n';

    UCubePaymentRequest->amount =1;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->currency = CURRENCY_EUR;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->transactionType = PURCHASE;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->readerList = readerList;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->authorizationTask = authorizationTask;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->riskManagementTask = riskManagementTask;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->applicationSelectionTask = applicationSelectionTask;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->preferredLanguageList = preferredLanguageList;

    UCubePaymentRequest->onProgress = onProgress ;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->onFinish = onFinish;
    

     //Add optional variables
     
    UCubePaymentRequest->forceOnlinePin = FALSE;
    
    err = get_date(&date);
    
    if(!err)
    {
       UCubePaymentRequest->transactionDate= date;
       
    }
    UCubePaymentRequest->forceAuthorisation = FALSE;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->cardWaitTimeout = 10000;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->systemFailureInfo2 = FALSE,
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->forceDebug = FALSE;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->skipCardRemoval = TRUE;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->authorizationPlainTags = authorizationPlainTags;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->authorizationSecuredTags =authorizationSecuredTags;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->finalizationPlainTags = finalizationPlainTags;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->finalizationSecuredTags =finalizationSecuredTags;
    
    UCubePaymentRequest->onlinePinBlockFormat = PIN_BLOCK_ISO9564_FORMAT_0;
    
    UCube_api_pay(UCubePaymentRequest);
    
    return err;
}

```

During the payment the  OnProgress() callback is called. The payment Context and State can be checked:

```c
void onProgress(UCubePaymentContext_t* context,PaymentState* state){

    PRINTF("********Payment State: %s \r\n", getStateName(*state));
    //TODO Put here your code
    
}
```

At the end of payment the Payment Context is returned and the callback onFinish is called:

```c
void onFinish(UCubePaymentContext_t* context){
   
    PRINTF("********Payment Status: %s \r\n", getStatusName(context->paymentStatus));
    //TODO Put here your code
  
}
```
- You can use the example provided in the customer_app (payment.c)

#### PaymentContext

The PaymentContext is the object that evoluates for each step of the payment and is returned at the end.

```c

//  payment context

#### PaymentState

You will receive the onProgress() callback for each new state. 

This is the whole liste of payement states :

#### EMV Payment state machine

![payment_state_machine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59020462/159264897-8a768f0e-e96c-4602-a06a-50bd49ccaea9.png)

The EMV payment state machine is sequence of executing commands and tasks. Bellow you will see the different tasks used at transaction

#### Tasks
Durring the payment process the payment state machine will be interrupted to execute some tasks that you implement.

#### ApplicationSelectionTask

```c
void applicationSelectionTask(EMVApplicationDescriptor *
		appList, uint8_t *size)
{
	   // TODO execute your application select algorithm here
}
```

#### RiskManagementTask

```c
uint8_t riskManagementTask(void){

	//TODO call your application risk management process
	
	//return response
}
```
#### AuthorizationTask

```c
uint8_t authorizationTask (void){

	//TODO call you backend here
	
       // at the end return the response
}
```

#### PaymentStatus

```c
typedef enum{
    APPROVED, // Transaction has been approved by terminal
    
    DECLINED, // Transaction has been declined by terminal

    /* Cancelled Status cases:

#### 4.2 Connectivity

#### Connect to cellular network

Create a network_handler_t variable:

```c
network_handler_t  network_handler_ct;
```

Initialize the network APN and set the prefered_network in the network handler to the cellular network. Then, call the UCube_api_connect.

```c
#define QL_DEF_APN_CT  "orange" 

error_t init_network(network_handler_t * network_handler) {

    error_t err = ERRORNO;
    
    strlcpy(network_handler->cellular_conf.apn, QL_DEF_APN_CT, QAPI_DSS_CALL_INFO_APN_MAX_LEN);
    
    network_handler->prefered_network = PREFERED_NETWORK_CELLULAR;
    
    UCube_api_connect(network_handler);
    
    return err;
}

```
#### Send HTTP request

Create a socket_handler_t variable :

```c
    socket_handler_t socket_handler_ct;
```

Define the request url and type (GET/POST) as below:

```c
    #define HTTP_REQUEST_URL  "https://webhook.site/5680215f-0091-45ab-b7b6-e2a9651df81e"
```

Initialize the HTTP request using in your socket_handler_t variable.Then, call the UCube_api_send_http_request with a pointer to your socket_handler. 

```c
error_t init_http_request(socket_handler_t * socket_handler) {

    error_t err = ERRORNO;

    // define url of request
    
    memset(socket_handler->request_url, 0, sizeof(socket_handler->request_url));
    
    sprintf((char*)socket_handler->request_url, HTTP_REQUEST_URL);
    
    socket_handler->url_length = strlen((const char *)socket_handler->request_url);
    
    socket_handler->request_type = HTTPS_CLIENT_GET_E ;
    
    socket_handler->requestResult_cb = requestResult_ct_cb;
    
    UCube_api_send_http_request(socket_handler);

    return err;
}
```

The request callback requestResult_ct_cb defined in init_http_request() is called at the end of http request.
Example is provided below: it displays the response code received from the server.

```c
void requestResult_ct_cb (https_request_handler_t request_handler){

    PRINTF("**Request result %d\r\n", request_handler.resp_Code);
    // TODO Put your code here
}
```

For each RPC there is a corresponding parameter defined in svpp_com_gen_data.h. Initialize the parameter's fields with the required values.
The example below shows how to initialize and send a get info RPC. The required parameter fields is tag.
The tag is initialized with the value of svpp version wich is : 0xD1 defined in SVPP_COM_TAG_INFO_SVPP_VERSION.
The response received in the parameter field service_ctx.rpc_ctx.param.

```c

void init_rpc(void)
{
    error_t err;
    
    uint8_t svpp_version[4];
    
    svpp_com_transaction_param_u param_ct;
    
    uint8_t tag =  0xD1;
    
    param_ct.ident_getinfo.tx_msg.pData = &tag;
    
    param_ct.ident_getinfo.tx_msg.len_data= sizeof(tag);
    
    err= UCube_api_send_Data(param_ct,(uint32_t)SVPP_COM_IDENT_GETINFO_CMD_NB);
    
    param_ct = *payment_ctx.rpc_ctx.param;
    
    if(err == ERRORNO ) {
    
        if((memcmp(param_ct.ident_getinfo.rx_msg.pData,&tag,sizeof(tag)))==0) {
	
            if(param_ct.ident_getinfo.rx_msg.pData[1] == sizeof(svpp_version)) {
	    
                memcpy(svpp_version, &param_ct.ident_getinfo.rx_msg.pData[2],  sizeof(svpp_version));
                        
                PRINTF("********** SVPP VERSION :");
                
                PRINTF_HEX_BUFFER(svpp_version,4);
                
                PRINTF("\r\n :");
            }
        }
    }
}
   
```

All this commands are described in the terminal documentation.

If the device is in secured state, the input / output data may be protected by a specific security level. The terminal documentation describes how input data and output data are protected for every command in each different security state.   
 
Note : In the secure session there is a sequence number managed by the SDK and incremented at every RPC call, If you need to know what is the current sequence number you cann get it using getCurrentSequenceNumber API.
- In the case of output, the SDK create e RPCMessage to store response.

Switch case of protection level, the parse of response will be different :
- In the case of none, it will be the same parse as Ready state, only commandId, status & data contain values.
- In the case of signed, commandId, status, data & data_mac contain values.
- In the case of signed and ciphered, commandId, status, data, data_mac & data_ciphered contain values.
Note that no MAC if the data is null.

## III. Task Creation

### 1.Introduction:
To create a task use the os_itf interface. Follow the sample code provided in customer_app.

### 2. Task Creation

Create and init task function to be called from appmodem.c. Create a queue and assign it to the your task. The task priority, stack size, name, and routine need to be passed to os_itf_task_create() function.

```c
/**
 * @brief    intialize customer app
 * create customer task and queue
 * @return  error
 */
error_t customer_app_init(void)
{
    error_t err = EFAIL;
    
    /* create queue for customer task*/
    err = os_itf_queue_create(&customer_app_ctx.queue,
                                QUEUE_CUSTOMER_APP_NAME,
                                OS_ITF_MAX_QUEUE_MSG_SIZE,
                                CUSTOMER_APP_MAX_MESSAGE_IN_QUEUE);

    if (err == ERRORNO){
    
        customer_app_ctx.task.stacksize = TASK_CUSTOMER_APP_STACK;
        customer_app_ctx.task.priority = TASK_CUSTOMER_APP_PRIORITY;
        customer_app_ctx.task.function = customer_app_routine;
        memcpy(customer_app_ctx.task.threadName, \
                TASK_CUSTOMER_APP_THREAD_NAME, \
                strlen(TASK_CUSTOMER_APP_THREAD_NAME));
        /* create  customer task*/
        err = os_itf_task_create(&customer_app_ctx.task);

        if (err != ERRORNO){
            PRINTF_VERBOSE("ERROR: customer_app_init, os_itf_task_create %d", err);
        }
    }
    
    else{
        PRINTF_VERBOSE("ERROR: customer_app_init, os_itf_queue_create %d", err);
    }

    return err;
   
}
```

### 3.Task Routine

Create the task routine and enter at as input to the function os_itf_task_create() as shown above.

Example:

```c
/**
 * @brief    main of customer app
 * @return  NULL
 */
TASK_FUNCTION_RETURN_TYPE customer_app_routine(TASK_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{

    error_t err = ERRORNO;
    
    for(;;){
    
      //TODO
       Put your code here
       
    }
    TASK_FUNCTION_RETURN_INSTRUCTION
    
}
```

### 4.Queue 
#### 4.1 send message to queue
To send a message to queue create the message with type "OS_ITF_QUEUE_API_ARG" and use the function os_itf_queue_send to send it.  

Example for sending a message to customer task:

```c          
            
 os_itf_queue_msg_t msg_from_main_to_customer_task;
 
 OS_ITF_QUEUE_API_ARG msg_to_queue = (OS_ITF_QUEUE_API_ARG)&msg_from_main_to_customer_task;
 
 msg_from_main_to_customer_task.type = MESSAGE_RECV;
 
 msg_from_main_to_customer_task.size = 1;
 
 msg_from_main_to_customer_task.payload.pData = &startApp;
 
 os_itf_queue_send(&customer_app_ctx.queue, msg_to_queue); 
                   
```
#### 4.2receive message in queue

To receive a message in queue, use the function  os_itf_queue_rcv() and indicate in parameter the queue and a pointer to the message to receive.

Example from customer task:

```c

/**
 * @brief    main of customer app
 * @return  NULL
 */
TASK_FUNCTION_RETURN_TYPE customer_app_routine(TASK_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{

    OS_ITF_QUEUE_API_ARG msg_from_queue;
    
    int status = -1;
    
    for(;;){
    
        /*receive message in queue */
